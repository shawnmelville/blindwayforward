# README.md file for the Blind Way Forward project.
## Introduction
The Blind Way Forward is a practical guide to coping and thriving with visual impairment. It was developed to enlighten and motivate persons who have developed a visual impairment and are not getting sufficient information about coping with blindness. It is different from traditional forms of support which are usually either web based or restricted to physical locations. It serves as a guide for visually impaired individuals and their families so that they can learn how to quickly and effectively adjust to vision loss.
